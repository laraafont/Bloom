# Bloom
Here is this the Figma link to Bloom, an eco-activism website prototype, which was awarded *Runner Up: Best Design for Gators* at Gator User Design 2025 Design-a-thon. I am currently working on realizing this prototype into an actual full-stack website!

Our inspiration came from the way people care about the environment, but they often don’t know where to start or how to take action locally. That’s what we’re trying to fix with Bloom. It’s a platform that connects people with their community through nearby cleanups, climate events, and political action, so getting involved feels easy and personal. We’re helping people reimagine community—not just as where you live, but as who you take action with. Because real change happens when neighbors come together, one neighborhood at a time.

We used FigJam to visualize our ideas. We started with moodboards to explore the visual identity of Bloom—focusing on natural colors like greens and beiges, clean design, and a welcoming, community-focused vibe. We also uploaded early sketches of a few of our pages, which helped us in making this idea come to life. We definitely learned a lot from this experience, it was our first design-athon and it was a lot of fun. Our biggest challenge was the learning curve we had to overcome for animating. We wanted our website to have as many animated elements and movement as possible, but we struggled grasping the concepts under the given time frame.

This is Bloom, our eco-friendly website to meet people in your area who share your green passion. This month’s highlighted community is New York City as you can see, and we have sliding info cards that showcase local initiatives, all designed to grab attention and inspire action right away. Next is our About page, where we highlight our mission statement- to connect people and help communities grow greener together. There’s also a cute plant to water as a reminder of how small actions can lead to real change.

Bloom is designed to make environmental action easier and more personal, so we hope you connect, take action, and Bloom
